# RPS
Rock Paper Scissors Game

I build this when I was first learning about JavaScript. 

As you can see from the files, it is made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I enjoyed this exercise and feel it taught me a lot about the flow and execution of the JS language.

The next challenge is builing it with React...

Thanks
